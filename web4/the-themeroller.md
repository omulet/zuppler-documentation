Great, let's activate the ThemeRoller now by adding `?themeRoller=true` param at the and of the page address. E.g. If the current page address is [http://myrestaurant.com/order-online.html](http://myrestaurant.com/order-online.html) then it should be [http://myrestaurant.com/order-online.html?themeRoller=true](http://myrestaurant.com/order-online.html?themeRoller=true)
