# The ThemeRoller

Is a little neat tool that lets you easily find the perfect colors for your menus with real time preview. To activate it, append the `?themeRoller=true` param at the and of the URL. E.g. If the current page address is [http://demo.zuppler.com/order-online-new.html](http://demo.zuppler.com/order-online-new.html) then it changes to [http://demo.zuppler.com/order-online-new.html**?themeRoller=true**](http://demo.zuppler.com/order-online-new.html?themeRoller=true).

Once the page reloads, you should see this ![](/assets/themeroller-button.png) on the right hand side bottom corner. Click to expand the tool.

The changes you will be doing here are **NOT persistent**. So if you refresh the page they will be gone. All this tool does is to let you preview colors and fonts changes in real time and most important to generate a new integration code base on these changes.
